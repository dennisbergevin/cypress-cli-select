## Installation

1. Install the following package:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress-cli-select
```

In order to run specific test(s) by their title, install the following plugin:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @bahmutov/cy-grep
```

Follow the installation and setup for `@bahmutov/cy-grep` in the project [README](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-grep)

---

## Run mode

If you want to select e2e spec(s) to run, simply run the following command:

```bash
npx cypress-cli-select run
```

For selecting component spec(s):

```bash
npx cypress-cli-select run --component
```

If you have [@bahmutov/cy-grep](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-grep) plugin installed in your project, you can also select tests to run by their title.

You can also include more cli arguments similar to `cypress run`, as the command harnesses the power of [Cypress module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api):

```bash
# Example
npx cypress-cli-select run --component --browser=chrome
```

```

### Keyboard controls

## Print selected

If you want to print all selected spec(s) and/or test(s)/tag(s) just prior to Cypress run, pass the following flag:

```bash
npx cypress-cli-select run --print-selected
```

![Cypress cli select --print-selected](./assets/print-selected-demo.png)

## Test diff output

At the end of the Cypress run, if the total tests in a spec file is not equal to the number of tests run from that spec file, you will see an output similar to the following:

![Cypress diff output demo](./assets/output-demo.png)

**Note**: Apart from indicating a grep test filtering was performed on a given spec during the Cypress run, this output is particularly helpful in detecting `.only()`.

---

## Using a custom cypress config

If you want to use a custom Cypress config, pass it via `--config-file` flag:

```bash
npx cypress-cli-select run --config-file tests/cypress.config.js
```

---

## Setting up a `npm` script

For convenience, you may desire to house the `npx` command within an npm script in your project's `package.json`, including any desired cli arguments:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "cy:select": "npx cypress-cli-select run --browser=firefox"
  }
```

---

## Typescript support

For more information on Typescript support involved with `@bahmutov/cy-grep` package, refer to it's [README](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-grep?tab=readme-ov-file#typescript-support).
